Introduction:

Hello!

To get practice for technical interviews and to become better at implementing algorithms in my own code,
i've began solving problems from Cracking the Coding Interview!

<br />

Notation:
---------

In my source code you will see java files labelled as <strong>L21.java</strong> which translates to the <strong>main</strong> method for <strong>Linked List</strong> question <strong>2.1</strong>

Make sure to take a look at the data structures used in each <strong>main</strong> file to understand the answer completely!
